SillyPilot is a mobile chat app for users to use to control SillyTavern remotely from a mobile, and add additional functionality such as:
- Push notifications
- A new mobile experience
- Browse character cards 
- Character card storage 

Summary of SillyPilot

SillyPilot is a mobile app designed to enhance user interaction with the SillyTavern AI chat application running on a local server. By leveraging features from the SillyTavern repositories, SillyPilot aims to deliver a polished, user-friendly experience that facilitates companionship through AI interactions.
Key Features and Functionality:

    AI Chat Management:
        SillyPilot connects to the SillyTavern API, enabling users to communicate seamlessly with their AI assistant. The app integrates functionality from the SillyTavern-STAHP repository, which handles user commands and processes API requests through polling. This setup allows the app to send messages and receive responses in real-time​(GitHub
        ).

    User-Centric Design:
        The UI is crafted to resemble modern chat applications, focusing on a clean and intuitive interface. Users can personalize their AI assistant, including renaming it and adjusting its appearance to reflect characteristics that enhance the sense of companionship. This ties into the desire for an intimate user experience​(GitHub
        )​(GitHub
        ).

    Local Storage:
        SillyPilot incorporates local storage capabilities to save chat histories and user settings. This allows users to revisit previous conversations, manage their AI’s character traits, and maintain continuity in interactions, even after closing the app. The integration of local storage supports functionality similar to that seen in web apps, ensuring that user data is preserved​(GitHub
        )​(GitHub
        ).

    Push Notifications:
        Drawing from the SillyTavern-PushNotifications repository, the app includes support for push notifications, keeping users informed of new messages from their AI assistant while they engage with other apps or when the app is closed. This feature is crucial for maintaining an engaging experience, mimicking real-time conversations​(GitHub
        )​(GitHub
        ).

    Enhanced Interactivity:
        SillyPilot utilizes features from the SillyTavern-Process repository to manage background tasks and optimize app performance. This could include managing idle states, allowing the AI to mimic casual check-ins, or enabling timed responses that keep users engaged​(GitHub
        ).

    Chat Features:
        The app allows for image uploads, sending and receiving multimedia messages, and customizing chat interfaces. Features like an idle slider can simulate interactions, and users can upload pictures to remind themselves of moments shared with their AI, fostering a deeper emotional connection​(GitHub
        ).

    Theming and Customization:
        Users can switch between themes, including a Catppuccin-inspired design with maroon and purple accents. This flexibility in visual styling not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also allows for a personalized touch that reflects user preferences.

    Responsive Mobile Experience:
        The app is designed with mobile responsiveness in mind, ensuring smooth animations between screens and a layout that adapts to various screen sizes. Features like a floating emoticon while waiting for responses enhance user engagement and mimic natural conversation dynamics​(GitHub
        )​(GitHub
        ).

Conclusion

SillyPilot is positioned to be a feature-rich mobile application that leverages the strengths of SillyTavern's repositories to create an engaging and intimate AI chat experience. By focusing on user personalization, local data management, and real-time communication, it aspires to provide a polished and seamless user experience that feels as natural as chatting with a friend. With its robust features and responsive design, SillyPilot stands to enhance the overall interaction between users and their AI companions.

Below are the features I want to implement and I need your help with.

Character Personalization:

    Users should be able to rename their AI character.
    The AI character should have a profile picture that can be uploaded and changed.
    The design should allow for styling features, where users can tweak their AI's characteristics (like "furry" options) to match the SillyTavern character.

Chat Features:

    Implement a "regenerate" button that allows users to resend messages to the AI.
    Include an "idle slider" feature that enables users to send an "Idle" message to their AI.
    Allow image uploads for users to share moments with their AI.

User Interface and Experience:

    The chat UI should be designed to feel like a modern mobile app, with smooth animations and transitions between screens.
    Include a floating emoticon (like ૮ • ﻌ - ა) in the chat bubble as a placeholder while waiting for a reply.
    Ensure the text box is mobile-friendly and can expand for larger images or replies, similar to Slack.
    Add a go-to-bottom button that appears only when users scroll up.

Settings and Configuration:

    Create a settings menu to access options like changing AI name, inputting the IP and port for the SillyTavern server, and theme selection.
    Implement basic IP validation and a ping status indicator that refreshes every minute.
    The settings menu should allow easy navigation and changes without feeling cluttered or confusing.

Theming:

    Integrate a Catppuccin-inspired theme with maroon and purple colors, allowing users to switch between themes.
    The app should incorporate CSS for customization, offering a unique visual experience.

Storage and Notifications:

    Implement local storage for saving chat logs and user settings to maintain continuity across app sessions.
    Include push notifications to keep users updated with new messages from their AI assistant.

Navigation:

    Ensure proper navigation routing for users to access the main menu, settings, and image gallery for each chat.
    Include a chat list feature to serve as a home screen for the app.

    Here's the docs for OpenRouter. We'll gear the database and frontend to support this chat type, and with each request to OpenRouter, you'll be including the contents of the character card, if any, but you hide this from the user only showing the message they typed. This creates an elegant response experience. I'll send it in a few messa
